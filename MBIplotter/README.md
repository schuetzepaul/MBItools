# MBIplotter
This python program creates a 2D Material Budget map from a TH3D containing the scattering angles of single tracks on a x-y-grid.

##Preparation:

Provide a TH3D with the kink angles in the specified rootfile, e.g. from EUTelescope.

##Usage:

'MBIplotter.py ROOTFILE HISTO [-r rebin] [-c cut] [-q quant]'
